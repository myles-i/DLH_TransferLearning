	abstract = {The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2017 focused on differentiating AF from noise, normal or other rhythms in short term (from 9-61 s) ECG recordings performed by patients. A total of 12,186 ECGs were used: 8,528 in the public training set and 3,658 in the private hidden test set. Due to the high degree of inter-expert disagreement between a significant fraction of the expert labels we implemented a mid-competition bootstrap approach to expert relabeling of the data, levering the best performing Challenge entrants' algorithms to identify contentious labels. A total of 75 independent teams entered the Challenge using a variety of traditional and novel methods, ranging from random forests to a deep learning approach applied to the raw data in the spectral domain. Four teams won the Challenge with an equal high F1 score (averaged across all classes) of 0.83, although the top 11 algorithms scored within 2% of this. A combination of 45 algorithms identified using LASSO achieved an F1 of 0.87, indicating that a voting approach can boost performance.},

@article{Weimann:2021wz,
	abstract = {Remote monitoring devices, which can be worn or implanted, have enabled a more effective healthcare for patients with periodic heart arrhythmia due to their ability to constantly monitor heart activity. However, these devices record considerable amounts of electrocardiogram (ECG) data that needs to be interpreted by physicians. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop reliable methods for automatic ECG interpretation to assist the physicians. Here, we use deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify raw ECG recordings. However, training CNNs for ECG classification often requires a large number of annotated samples, which are expensive to acquire. In this work, we tackle this problem by using transfer learning. First, we pretrain CNNs on the largest public data set of continuous raw ECG signals. Next, we finetune the networks on a small data set for classification of Atrial Fibrillation, which is the most common heart arrhythmia. We show that pretraining improves the performance of CNNs on the target task by up to {\$}{\$}6.57{$\backslash$}{\%}{\$}{\$}, effectively reducing the number of annotations required to achieve the same performance as CNNs that are not pretrained. We investigate both supervised as well as unsupervised pretraining approaches, which we believe will increase in relevance, since they do not rely on the expensive ECG annotations.

@article{Rahhal:2016,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on deep learning for active classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To this end, we learn a suitable feature representation from the raw ECG data in an unsupervised way using stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) with sparsity constraint. After this feature learning phase, we add a softmax regression layer on the top of the resulting hidden representation layer yielding the so-called deep neural network (DNN). During the interaction phase, we allow the expert at each iteration to label the most relevant and uncertain ECG beats in the test record, which are then used for updating the DNN weights. As ranking criteria, the method relies on the DNN posterior probabilities to associate confidence measures such as entropy and Breaking-Ties (BT) to each test beat in the ECG record under analysis. In the experiments, we validate the method on the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as well as two other databases called INCART, and SVDB, respectively. Furthermore, we follow the recommendations of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) for class labeling and results presentation. The results obtained show that the newly proposed approach provides significant accuracy improvements with less expert interaction and faster online retraining compared to state-of-the-art methods.},
