This is challenging and expensive to annotate for effective Deep Learning training.\n","  - Large class imbalance due to cardiovascular events of interests being rare.\n","  - Low ECG signal quality due to sampling frequency, single ECG lead probe.\n","\n","- **The state of the art methods**:\n","\n","  - Transfer learning using 1-D residual networks [3]\n","  - Representation learning using encoder-decoder architectures\n","    - Stacked Denoising AEs [4]\n","    - Seq2Seq model [5]\n","\n","## Paper Explanation\n","- **What did the paper propose**:\n","\n","  - Use Transfer learning to build better ECG classifiers.\n","  - Pre-train 1-D CNNs on the largest publicly available ECG dataset (_Icentia11K_) on several pre-training tasks:\n","    - Beat Classification\n","    - Rhythm Classifcation\n","    - Heart Rate Classification\n","    - Future Prediction\n","  - Finetune the pre-trained 1-D CNNs on a _different_ task and a _different_ dataset (_PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017_): classify AF events.\n","\n","- **What is/are the innovations of the method**:\n","\n","  - Demonstration of successful large-scale pre-training of 1-D CNNs on the largest publicly available ECG dataset to date.\n","  - Demonstration of contrastive pre-training (unsupervised representation learning) improving 1-D CNN performance on target task.\n","  - Novel usage of heart rate classification task for pre-training. Note that in this task, the labels can be automatically generated without manual intervention.\n","\n","- **How well the proposed method work (in its own metrics)**:\n","\n","  - The paper provides AF classifier performnace comparison among five different pre-training tasks configurations (Random initalization, Beat classification, Rhythm classification, Heart Rate classification, and Future Prediction). _Macro F1 score of the AF classifier on the Physionet test set is the performance metric._\n","  - The average macro F1 score of random initalization pre-training task is 0.731 over 10 trials. Average macro F1 scores reported by all proposed four pre-training tasks configurations range from 0.758 to 0.779 over 10 trials.\n","\n","- **What is the contribution to the research regime (referring the Background above, how important the paper is to the problem)**:\n","\n","  - Pre-training the 1-D CNN model improves the performance on the target task (i.e. AF classification), effectively reducing the number of labeled data required to achieve the same performance as 1-D CNNs that are not pre-trained.\n","  - Unsupervised pre-training (i.e. future prediction) on ECG data is a viable method for improving the performance on the target task and will become more relevant, since labeling ECG data is expensive."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uygL9tTPSVHB"},"source":["# Scope of Reproducibility\n","\n","## Hypothesis 1\n","Pre-training 1-D CNN models with an extremely large dataset of relatively inexpensively labeled data can improve performance of classification based on a smaller set of labeled data with a different classification objective (i.e. AF).\n","\n","## Hypothesis 2\n","The paper does not explore how significant the effects of the pre-training data size are on the final results. We assume size of the pre-training dataset could affect the performance of the target task (i.e. AF classification).\n","\n","\n","## Verification\n","We will verify the hypotheses by attempting to reproduce results for a specific model and the following hyperparameter combination with 10% and 20% of the pre-training data used in the paper:\n","\n","- Model: 1-D ResNet-18v2\n","- Pre-training Objective: Beat Classification\n","- Frame Size: 4096 samples\n","- Sample Rate: 250 Hz\n","- Fine-tuning objective: Atrial Fibrillation\n","\n","Note that the data is at patient level, so the 10% and 20% will be applied to the total number of patients.\n","\n","The results will be compared with the performance of a randomly initialized ResNet-18v2.\n","\n","## Implementation\n","\n","The paper authors have provided their code online on Github. In our repo, we have forked their code and made small adjustments for convenience in our reproduction work. The code cells below will import modules from the paper authors' code. In this way, we are able to focus primarily on executing the experiments and analyzing the outcomes.\n","\n","# Ablation (Hypothesis 3)\n","The original paper is entirely based on 1-D CNNs and the raw ECG signal. To extend the paper's results, we aim to pre-process the raw signals using Fourier transforms to represent the data as a spectogram -- a frequency versus time representation of ECG signals.\n","\n","Using this representation of the input, we will train a 2-D CNN model (i.e. 2-D ResNet-18v2) and compare the performance of pre-trained and randomly initialized models. Additionally, we will compare the 2-D model performance to the 1-D models originally used by the authors.\n","\n","This extension is motivated by a study on ECG Arrhythmia classification that demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs trained on spectrograms.[6] By converting ECG data to spectrogram features and then using spectrograms to pre-train a 2-D ResNet, we intend to illustrate the adaptability of the transfer learning framework in the original paper across diverse model architectures.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xWAHJ_1CdtaA"},"source":["# Methodology\n","\n","## Environment\n","\n","First, we assume that this notebook is run in **Google Colab**.
